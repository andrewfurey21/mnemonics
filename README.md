# Mnemonics
## Purpose
The goal of this program is to create my own mnemonics for different languages, to learn the vocabulary fast. 
Languages I want to include: german, spanish, english, japanese.

## Method 
I tried to search for a dataset that would regroup like 2000+ most used vocabulary, however I did not find a viable csv file.
Therefore for example for the german dataset, I will be manually inputting all my data in my format using a website that regroups the most frequent vocab.

## Technical
I want to code in python, using tkinter (Never used before, but seems as a simple GUI )
It is only supposed to work locally on my computer.

## TO DO
* I don't need the num in the csv
* When going to new word
  1. first show the word
  2. Option to show the mnemonic
  3. Option to show the meaning
* Option to have modes:
  1. Random words each time you go next
  2. You can input the page where they are all sorted originally so just go through all by inputing a number
  3. Only show those that don't have mnemonics?
* Add phonetic ?
   
## Current bugs
* mnemonics may be written in the wrong row...
* If u press submit button several times it will spawn infinte
    ` Should disappear and update the page to see the new mnemonic`
* all the submit button stays even after u change pages??
* The update dict function is super inefficient but for now I dont see alternatives ` What if i only updated the dictionary that has already read in the csv and then when i would press a quit button it would save it to csv?`
* when i press show + hide it produces a new submit button ????
## Additional
